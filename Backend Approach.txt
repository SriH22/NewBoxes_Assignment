Ai News Feed Approach - Simple Explanation

What This Code Does

This is a  smart news collector that automatically gathers daily news from various sources  removes duplicates, and adds AI-powered summaries, and key words - all saving to a simple JSON file.

Step-by-Step Approach

1.News Collection 
# Like a web browser visiting news websites
- Goes to The Hindu homepage
- Goes to Times of India homepage  
- Finds all article links and titles
- Collects basic info (title, link, date)

2. Smart Duplicate Removal
# Prevents storing same news multiple times
- Compares new articles with existing ones
- Checks if titles are identical or very similar
- Only keeps truly new articles
- Like having a smart filter

3. AI Enhancement 
# For each new article:
1. Reads full article content
2. Uses Groq AI to understand the article
3. Creates short 2-3 sentence summary  
4. Extracts important keywords
5. Saves everything together

4. Simple Storage System
# Uses JSON files as database
- One file per day: "news_articles_2024-01-15.json"
- Easy to read and understand
- Contains everything: articles + AI analysis
