
This is a Streamlit-based news feed application that displays, searches, and organizes news articles from a JSON data source. The app provides an intuitive interface for users to browse news, search for specific topics, and manage their favorite subjects.

Core Approach

1. Data Loading & Management
JSON-based Storage: News articles are stored in daily JSON files with a structured format containing titles, summaries, sources, dates, and keywords

Automatic Date Handling: Uses current date to load the appropriate news file

Error Handling: Robust error management for missing files or invalid JSON data

2. User Interface Design
Multi-tab Navigation: Organized into three main sections:

News Feed: Main browsing interface

Favorites: Personalized feed based on user interests

Manage Favorites: Topic customization interface

Sidebar Navigation: Consistent navigation and search across all pages

Responsive Layout: Clean card-based article display with collapsible details

3. Article Display System
Two-view System:

Summary View: Compact cards showing title, source, date, and brief summary

Detailed View: Full article expansion when users click "Read More"

Progressive Disclosure: Users can quickly scan summaries and dive deeper when interested

4. Search & Filtering
Dual Search Strategy: Implements both AI-powered and keyword-based searching

Session State Management: Maintains search results across user interactions

Clear Navigation: Easy switching between search results and full feed

AI Integration
Intelligent Search with Groq API
The app uses AI-powered semantic search through the Groq API with the llama-3.1-8b-instant model:

How AI Search Works:
Context Preparation:

All articles are formatted into a structured context with titles, AI summaries, and keywords

Creates a comprehensive knowledge base for the AI to analyze

Smart Query Processing:

The AI doesn't just match keywords—it understands the meaning behind search queries

Example: Searching "economic growth" can find articles about "GDP increase", "market expansion", etc.

Precision Response:

AI returns only the most relevant article indices

Uses low temperature (0.1) for consistent, focused results

Limited tokens (50) to ensure concise, structured responses

Fallback Mechanism:

If AI parsing fails, automatically switches to traditional keyword search

Ensures search functionality never completely breaks

Benefits of AI Search:
Semantic Understanding: Finds articles that conceptually match the query, not just keyword matches

Context Awareness: Considers the relationship between title, summary, and keywords

Natural Language Queries: Users can search like they're asking a question

Better Relevance: More accurate results compared to simple keyword matching

AI-Generated Content
Articles include AI-written summaries for quick consumption

Keyword extraction likely powered by AI/NLP techniques

Provides cleaner, more consistent content presentation
