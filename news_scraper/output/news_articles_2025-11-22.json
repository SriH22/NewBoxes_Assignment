You can subscribe here to get the newsletter in your inbox every Friday.)\n\nU.S. Vice-President J.D. Vance’s hope that his wife Usha would one day become a Christian triggered a range of reactions, mostly critical. Mr. Vance is being attacked by Christian nationalists for having a Hindu wife, by Hindu activists for questioning his wife’s Hindu faith, and by progressives for mixing religion with politics.\n\nAn Indian President and his wife went through similar hubbub over their respective faiths, though they were lucky that social media had not become what it is today. Ashok Singhal, president of the Vishva Hindu Parishad, accused India’s first Dalit President, K.R. Narayanan, of hiding his Christian faith. The allegations resurfaced in 2017 when Ram Nath Kovind was nominated as President by the BJP. A section of BJP supporters claimed Mr. Kovind was the first Dalit President of India since Narayanan was a Christian.\n\nNarayanan’s wife, Usha, was born Christian in Burma. Her name was Tint Tint and she became Usha later on. She lies at rest in the Christian cemetery on Prithviraj Road near Khan Market in central Delhi. Few people in Hindu-majority India cared that Usha, a practising Christian, was the First Lady from 1997 to 2002. Her tomb carries a marker for Narayanan too: ‘A Gentle Colossus, 4-2-1921 – 9-11-2005, President of India 1997-2002, Loving husband of Usha Narayanan’ — a detail that resurfaced in public conversation in 2017. Usha died in 2008, three years after Narayanan, who passed away in 2005.\n\nTheir daughters, Amrita Narayanan and Chitra Narayanan, told the media in 2017 that their father was Hindu and that his last rites were conducted according to Hindu rituals. They said:\n\n“After the funeral, the ashes were distributed in four parts. One part of the urns containing the ashes was taken by train to Haridwar, where they were immersed in the Ganga by the eldest daughter. The second part of the urns was accompanied by the younger daughter and taken to Kerala, where the State government arranged the procession to the Bharathapuzha, a sacred river in Kerala. The ashes were immersed according to Hindu rites by Narayanan’s younger brother, K.R. Bhaskaran, who was a close associate of the BJP. The third part of the ashes was mingled with those of Narayanan’s late parents. The final and small portion was retained by his widow, Usha Narayanan, a Christian, to be buried alongside her. At her passing in 2008, this was done according to her wishes at the Prithviraj Road cemetery. This was an entirely private wish and should be respected accordingly.”\n\nNarayanan and Usha were born in the same country, British India, but by the time they married in 1951, she was counted as a foreigner. Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru granted Narayanan, then an Indian diplomat, permission to marry a foreign national. Their remains rest in the same grave today. Tomorrow is another day.\n\nReturning to the present, Usha Vance remains a Hindu, but the couple are raising their children as Christians, Mr. Vance announced recently. Their eight-year-old son, Vivek, had his first communion a year ago. Mr. Vance has written about his own conversion to Catholicism. Born into an evangelical Christian family, he became an atheist and then a Catholic. That makes me wonder: how did newly elected Mayor of New York Zohran Mamdani, born to a Hindu mother and Muslim father, become Muslim? Let me explain.\n\nNearly all of us are born into the religion, caste, gender, and nationality that we live in. Only a small proportion ever gets to choose any part of these identities. That happens when people convert to a different religion, or acquire a new citizenship. They give up what they were born into and become something new, as part of self-discovery or in search of something different.\n\nBut for almost everyone, our ascribed identities are simply inherited from our parents. For people born to mixed parentage, however, the inheritance of group membership becomes more complex. They are exposed to at least two different options. When they choose the religion or citizenship of one parent, it must be one of the following: either their parents choose on their behalf (as in the case of the Vance children), or they choose as adults, based on what suits them best (as Mr. Vance did).\n\nIf they choose for themselves as adults, it is a conscious decision; it is unlike the experience of most of us, who belong to a particular community purely by accident of birth. For instance, Indian Muslims are Indian and Muslim by accident; but Indian Americans are Americans by choice — they gave up their Indian citizenship to become American.\n\nMr. Mamdani is today a Muslim. He inherited two religious options from his parents. He is in his father’s religion, not his mother’s Hindu religion. Since he is celebrated as an icon of progressive politics, I am curious to know how he arrived at that position. Did his parents jointly decide to raise him a Muslim? Or did he make that decision through his own exploration as an adult?\n\nAlthough I could not find any explanation from Mr. Mamdani on how or why he became Muslim - like Mr. Vance has done about his conversion to Catholicism -- he has explained why he asserted his Muslim identity during the campaign. He said it was to push back against the prejudices the community faced. That is a legitimate explanation within what is generally considered a progressive political framework. But it leads to another question: why is the assertion of a minority religious identity an acceptable expression of political claims, while the assertion of a majority religious identity is deemed repulsive? I am not persuaded by the typical answers — such as ‘majority religious identities can lead to majoritarianism’ and are therefore more dangerous.\n\nAs an armchair liberal, these are my dilemmas of the week.\n\nFederalism Tract: Notes on Indian Diversity\n\nSupreme Governors\n\nA five-judge Bench of the Supreme Court on Thursday (November 20, 2025) answered the 16th Presidential Reference the country has witnessed by opining that the judiciary cannot fetter Governors and the President to ‘one-size-fits-all’ time-tables to dispose of State Bills or usurp their functions by assuming ‘deemed consent’ of the proposed laws at the expiry of a court-ordered time frame.\n\nMuslims count less in Bihar\n\nMuslims make up 17.7% of Bihar’s population, according to the 2022 Bihar Caste Census. While they have historically been under-represented in the State Assembly, accounting for less than 10% of its members, this election marks a new low, with their presence in the 243-member House dropping to just 4.5%.",

      "success": "Theo Wait was studying at University College London in 2011 when he rediscovered chess. He had been taught the game by his grandfather, but he never really continued with it. Wait’s best friend at college, a Frenchman, sent him a link to play chess on a new French website he had come across. It was called Lichess.\n\nWait first played with his friend and then others on the site. He found Lichess cool. Some 14 years and a pandemic later, Lichess has become a lot cooler. Or hotter, if you look at the numbers, or the influence it has on the game of chess.\n\nEverything you need\n\nLichess is free, open source, has no ads, and requires no registration. It lets millions from across the world, ranging from amateurs to World champions, play chess online, learn its intricacies, and watch live all the major tournaments, including the World Championship and the World Cup.\n\nLichess does all that with just three full-time workers. Wait is one of them. Founder Thibault Duplessis and mobile developer Vincent Velociter are the others. An army of volunteers from around the globe keeps the website running and growing, ensuring the game of chess is accessible to everyone, without ever having to pay a subscription fee. It operates with donations (averaging five Euros per contributor).\n\n“I began volunteering my time by trying to translate the website into Russian, as I was a student of the language then,” Wait tells The Hindu at Arpora, Goa, during the World Cup, which he is covering for Lichess. “Around 2013, Thibault reached out to me and he said, ‘You know, would you like to be part of the team?’”\n\nWait could not have imagined at the time that he was going to be a part of something truly unique, in the internet and social spaces. Lichess is not just one of the world’s leading gaming websites, it is one of the most popular open source projects as well.\n\n“Lichess is now one of the 200 or 300 biggest websites in the world by traffic,” says Wait, who works as the director of operations. “We have hundreds of millions of visits every month. We provide a completely free platform for anyone to play or learn chess. We have all of the learning materials that you need to learn how to play chess, given entirely for free. We have courses, we have studies. Anyone interested in chess can begin experimenting with it.”\n\nHow did it all begin?\n\n“Lichess was born when Thibault, a very talented programmer, wanted to learn a new developing language called Scala,” says Wait. “So, to practise with this, he began creating a chess website, because it has lots of features which are very useful for programming.”\n\nThere were teething troubles, yes. “Thibault wasn’t a formal chess player and in the early Lichess, we didn’t get all the chess rules correctly,” recalls Wait. “For example, en passant didn’t exist, or you could castle through check. But those issues were fixed very early. He created a chat feature, using which people pointed out flaws.”\n\nNow, people are talking about the important role Lichess plays in the growth of chess. Vidit Gujrathi, who was part of the Olympiad-winning Indian team, says he has great regard for the service Lichess offers the game. “Now its mobile application is much smoother and it is through Lichess that I follow tournaments,” he tells The Hindu over the phone. “I have a lot of respect for Thibault, who is running it with his passion.”\n\nRinging endorsements\n\nThe other day, Vidit, the current World No. 27, had posted on X: “Such an amazing open source work…” Anish Giri, the World No. 5 from the Netherlands, replied: “Absolutely.”\n\n“Such endorsements matter to Lichess,” says Wait. “They motivate the team. There have been many top players who have found Lichess useful in many ways, including their preparation. Javokhir Sindarov, who has done well at the World Cup here, said he was using the Lichess features for his preparation, including opening. The world’s best players play on Lichess, though some of them may not be revealing their identities.”\n\nMillions of games are played on Lichess every day. “I think it is about 3.5 million games a day, the rated ones that is; but if you take unrated games played against bots engines or the anonymous games, you’re looking at maybe around six-seven million,” says Wait. “Of course, the pandemic saw a huge spurt in the traffic. Just before COVID-19, we were averaging maybe around 50,000 people online at any given time, but that number tripled in 2020.”\n\nChess was, in fact, the only game that grew during the pandemic. The world chess governing body did well to take chess to more people by using several online tournaments, including an Online Chess Olympiad, in which India was declared the joint-winner with Russia (which had won the final but had to share the title after India successfully appealed against an internet outage).\n\nChess is a game most ideal for the internet. All you need is a mobile phone and decent connectivity to play an interesting game. And, of course, Lichess isn’t the only website out there for chess. There are the likes of chess.com and Chessbase (and its hugely popular Indian version).\n\nLichess wants to ensure that chess remains free and is not corporatised. “We are not for sale,” says Wait. “We have had lots of interest from many other people and some companies, including a big one back in 2016-2017. It is imperative that Lichess keeps going; I know many people cannot afford subscription fees. And nobody wants to see a monopoly.”\n\nIt is expensive to keep Lichess going. “It costs us around 720,000 US dollars a year to run Lichess,” he says. “That includes salaries and servers, moderators, content, and the prize-fund tournaments that we put out. And those tournaments are important, too. At the end of the day, it is very nice for titled players to have an opportunity to just earn some money, you know, playing chess as well.”\n\nFinancial support\n\nWait says most of the financial contributions come from North America and Europe. “That is not surprising, as there is a big disparity in wealth globally, right?” he points out. “If a company was interested in supporting us, we would definitely be open to a conversation. And, of course, one can contribute by volunteering, too.”\n\nLichess would like to do more in India, which is second only to Russia in terms of the number of followers. “I would really like to do more just within grassroots chess in India,” says Wait. “And we would like to work on getting chess into schools and education.”",

      "success": "On October 10, following in the footsteps of Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, Kerala declared snakebite envenomation a disease of public health importance under the Kerala Public Health Act, 2023. This notification is in accordance with the Centre’s directive to implement the 2024 National Action Plan for Snakebite Envenoming, an initiative to halve snakebite-related deaths in India by 2030. Of the nearly 78,600 snakebite deaths annually reported worldwide, over 64,000 deaths occur in India, according to a study published in the peer-reviewed journal, Nature Communications, in 2022.\n\nDr. Ajan M.J., Assistant Director, Health and Family Welfare Department, who is the State nodal officer for snakebite envenomation management, says the notification will enable more accurate tracking of snakebite cases, including their frequency, severity, and geographic spread. “This, in turn, will provide clearer epidemiological insights by revealing trends, hotspots, and vulnerable populations. More importantly, it will help us ensure adequate stock of ASV (anti-snake venom) in high-incidence regions and in boosting hospital readiness,” he says.\n\nThis moment did not appear out of nowhere. It was shaped, painfully and irrevocably, by a sequence of events that forced the State to confront the cost of human-wildlife conflict.\n\nAlso Read | High costs, poor training deepen India’s stinging snakebite toll\n\nDanger in a crevice\n\nOn the morning of November 20, 2019, Shehala Sherin, 10, set out for school with a lunch box in hand. Sherin, a Class 5 student at the Government Sarvajana Vocational Higher Secondary School in Sulthan Bathery in Wayanad district, was accompanied by her cousin Nihal N. Firoz, also 10 years old.\n\nOn that cool afternoon, when she was in the classroom, Sherin’s foot slipped into a crevice beneath her bench. She cried out. Her parents Abdul Azis N.V. and Sajna Aysha later learnt that a venomous snake curled up there had bitten her.\n\n“A place that should have been a haven for our child became the beginning of our nightmare,” says Azis, recalling the worst day of his life.\n\nTo make matters worse, there was a delay in taking Sherin to the hospital. “She was lying in pain as people stood confused around her. I arrived at the school at 3:50 (p.m.) and took her to the hospital.” Sherin had been bitten nearly 40 minutes earlier. There was already redness and swelling in that area and she was in visible pain.\n\nThey rushed the child to a private hospital nearby, which referred her to the Sulthan Bathery Taluk Hospital, nearly 2 kilometres away. “While the hospital had an adequate stock of ASV, they did not have ventilator support,” says Azis. The doctors recommended that she be taken to the Kozhikode Government Medical College, nearly 90 km away.\n\n“Her condition had deteriorated rapidly by then. On the way, the ambulance went to the Vythiri Taluk Hospital, where doctors again said they could not handle the case,” Azis says. From there, Sherin was shifted to a private hospital in Chelod, around 5 km away. At 6:15 p.m., she was pronounced dead.\n\n“The classroom floor had cracks and no pest control checks had been carried out,” alleges Azis. “No one took responsibility for the safety of children in that school. Not the teachers, not the administration.”\n\nThe incident exposed the inability of the State to handle snakebite cases even though 123 people had died of snakebite during 2018-2019. The preventable death of a child led the Kerala High Court to initiate suo moto proceedings on December 9, 2019. This resulted in major school infrastructural upgrades and safety guidelines.\n\nAlso Read | Blood of man bitten by hundreds of snakes leads to strong anti-venom\n\nUsing snakes as a weapon\n\nJust months after Sherin’s death, a snakebite again dominated headlines in Kerala. In May 2020, a bank clerk from Kollam city, Sooraj Kumar, used a venomous snake to kill his wife, Uthra. He clutched the Indian cobra by its hood and pressed it near Uthra while she was sleeping. The agitated snake bit her twice, killing her. Cobra venom can kill a person in hours by paralysing respiratory muscles.\n\nThis was not Kumar’s first attempt at killing his wife, the investigation revealed. Two months earlier, he had tried to kill Uthra by releasing a Russell’s viper, another venomous snake, into the bedroom. The viper had bitten her, but she survived after hospitalisation. While that was dismissed by the family as an unfortunate accident, Uthra’s parents filed a police complaint after her death. The police arrested Kumar.\n\nDuring their investigation, the police learnt that Kumar had bought the snakes from traditional snake charmers and unlicensed handlers who illegally keep wild snakes in captivity. His motive was to get hold of Uthra’s gold and claim her life insurance payout. The Additional District and Sessions Court-VI, Kollam, deemed the case “rarest of the rare”, and sentenced Kumar to a double life term along with 17 years of rigorous imprisonment.\n\nYet another tragic incident occurred in July that year when Zakir Hussain, a snake catcher, died after being bitten by a cobra he had rescued from a house in Navaikulam, Thiruvananthapuram. He reportedly carried out the rescue by grabbing the snake with his bare hands, as was the prevalent practice then, and displayed it proudly to onlookers. “The snake bit him on his right wrist and the venom rapidly spread through the vein,” says Assistant Conservator of Forests, Muhammed Anwar Y.\n\nAlso Read | Call for region-specific antivenoms to save snakebite victims\n\nThe success of SARPA\n\nKerala, with its dense tropical forests, extensive wetlands, and high population density, has for years grappled with the deadly threat of snakebites. The region is home to more than 130 snake species, of which around 10 are venomous, according to the Forest Department.\n\nSnake envenoming, often occurring in agricultural fields, forested areas, and urban spaces, has always presented a major health challenge. Data from the State Health Department show that nearly 5,000 cases of snakebites are reported annually in the State. Yet, the actual figures could be far higher, with many snakebite incidents going unreported, particularly in rural areas. Besides the human toll, over the past decade, nearly 70% of the wildlife-related deaths reported in Kerala have been due to snakebites, according to the department.\n\nThe deaths of Uthra and Hussain and especially Sherin were turning points in the State’s response to the crisis. “They prompted the Forest Department to launch SARPA (Snake Awareness, Rescue, and Protection App) in August 2020,” Anwar points out. The mobile application connects people with trained rescuers, provides first-aid information on snakebites, and assists people with identifying snake species.\n\nThe senior forest official adds that the initiative is the first of its kind in India. With traditional rescue methods deemed unscientific and risky, snake rescuers and department officials are now trained in the scientific ‘bag and pipe’ method using safety gear. This is a technique that involves the use of a pipe inserted into a sturdy cloth bag to guide a snake to safety without direct physical contact. So far, nearly 6,200 people have received training under the programme. These include people from a cross-sections of society, including doctors, professors, advocates, IT professionals, casual labourers, and researchers.\n\nAnwar, who is also the State nodal officer of SARPA, says the initiative has been successful. “Within five years, snakebite-related deaths have reduced from 123 in 2018-19 to 34 in 2024-25,” he says. There have been 14 deaths so far during the ongoing fiscal, with the latest being reported on November 21, when an infant was bitten by a cobra in Malappuram. “Nearly 58,000 snakes have been safely rescued and released back into their natural habitats,” he adds.\n\nPramod G. Krishnan, Chief Wildlife Warden, says the recent declaration of snakebite envenomation as a notifiable disease will be a “shot in the arm” for Kerala’s goal of zero snakebite deaths by 2030. The Forest Department is now all set to launch the second phase of SARPA with expanded resources and training.\n\nEnvironmental and lifestyle shifts have also contributed to fewer human-snake encounters. “The elimination of open defecation, near-universal LPG coverage and reduced dependence on firewood, and mechanised farming practices have all helped,” says Dr. Jaideep C. Menon, Professor, Adult Cardiology and Public Health, Amrita Institute of Medical Sciences, Kochi.\n\nBesides, the Local Self Government Department, the General Education Department, and other departments have adopted many precautionary measures. “Safety audits are being regularly conducted in schools before each academic year to identify and rectify potential hazards,” Anwar says.\n\nThe State has also prioritised supplying safety equipment, including gumboots and gloves, to Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) workers, given the risks of snake encounters in rural regions.\n\nShyamala M., a MGNREGS worker in Palode, Thiruvananthapuram, points out that she is now given gloves while carrying out tasks such as clearing vegetation. “Last year, one of my colleagues was bitten by a hump-nosed pit viper. Incidents like that used to be common,” she says.\n\nWayanad-based physician Dr. Rajesh Kumar M.P., who also serves as a SARPA educator, says efforts are being made to spread awareness about snakes and venomous species, particularly among the youth. SARPA Padam, an educational programme, is being rolled out across educational institutions. Awareness sessions are also conducted for groups such as Kudumbasree.\n\nAlso Read | Study finds climate change could drive new snakebite hotspots in India\n\nThe hurdles that remain\n\nDespite achieving significant progress in handling snakes and preventing snakebite-related fatalities, Kerala still faces challenges, however.\n\nNationally, snakebite mitigation largely centres around the Big Four snake species — the Indian cobra, the common krait, the Russell’s viper, and the saw-scaled viper. However, in Kerala, the hump-nosed pit viper is increasingly responsible for snakebite cases. The viper is an endemic species to the Western Ghats.\n\nDr. Menon attributes the rise in hump-nosed pit viper bites to the shift in agricultural patterns from paddy cultivation to plantation-based cash crops, such as rubber and cardamom. The venomous species is known to prefer cool, moist environments, such as dense forests and plantations. It is mostly found in leaf litter and thick bushes.\n\nThe polyvalent ASV that is produced in India utilises venom from the Big Four. However, studies have shown that it is ineffective in neutralising the venom of the hump-nosed pit viper.\n\nDr. Menon, who also heads the ICMR-Collaborative Centre of Excellence in Snakebite, stresses the need to establish regional venom collecting centres. “This is necessary to improve antivenom production by developing both region-specific and species-specific antivenoms,” he says.\n\nAt present, like most other States, Kerala relies on the ASV produced from the venom extracted by the Irula Snake Catchers’ Industrial Cooperative Society in Chengalpattu, Tamil Nadu. The Irula are an indigenous community known for their traditional skills in snake and rat catching. In July 2025, while inaugurating the World Snake Day observance in Thiruvananthapuram, Forest Minister A.K. Saseendran announced plans to locally produce ASV to address the perceived ineffectiveness of current antivenoms due to geographical variation in venom potency.\n\nSustaining SARPA’s momentum is another challenge, according to a senior forest official. Of the 3,300 trained and licensed snake rescuers, fewer than 1,000 remain active. “While many snake enthusiasts have undergone training in snake rescue, they are rarely available on short notice, given their daily jobs,” the official says.\n\nA rapid response team (RRT) member in Pathanamthitta points out that snake-related emergencies in the region are primarily handled by Forest Department personnel, largely due to the lack of licensed snake handlers in the area. While RRT teams have been effective in managing a range of emergencies, their resources are increasingly being stretched, particularly as forest fringe areas report a rise in conflicts involving other wild animals such as elephants and wild boars. To address the issue, the department is mulling steps to ensure at least one active licensed snake handler in each local body.\n\nPersisting medical challenges too remain a significant barrier to effective snakebite management. “There is clinical hesitancy in administering ASV, primarily due to fear of anaphylaxis (a severe, life-threatening allergic reaction). This is often linked to inadequate training and insufficient infrastructure to manage complications,” says a health officer.\n\nTimely and effective pre-hospital care too is vital in reducing snakebite-related mortality. While emergency services exist, most snakebite victims still rely on private transport. Experts have called for strengthening ambulance services to include snakebite management protocols, and for implementing a hub-and-spoke model, where community health centres and taluk hospitals support a network of primary health centres.\n\nHerpetologist Sandeep Das says Kerala’s focus on snakebite mitigation in recent times has had a cascading effect on conservation efforts. “Snakes play a vital role in maintaining a healthy ecosystem by controlling rodent population. This in turn helps reduce the spread of zoonotic diseases,” he says.\n\nDas, who has been actively involved in SARPA and Snakepedia, a comprehensive database on snake species found in Kerala, adds that there has been a perceptible shift in public attitudes towards snakes. “Where fear and hostility once dominated, there is now a growing sense of awareness and respect for these often misunderstood reptiles. Increasingly, people are recognising their ecological importance and the need to respond to encounters with scientific knowledge, rather than fear-driven actions like killing them on sight,” he says.\n\nAs the State pushes towards its goal of zero snakebites, the systemic overhaul sparked by a child’s death continues to serve as both a cautionary tale and a catalyst for change.\n\nsarath.bg@thehindu.co.in",

So far, nearly 6,200 people have received training under the programme. These include people from a cross-sections of society, including doctors, professors, advocates, IT professionals, casual labourers, and researchers.\n\nAnwar, who is also the State nodal officer of SARPA, says the initiative has been successful. “Within five years, snakebite-related deaths have reduced from 123 in 2018-19 to 34 in 2024-25,” he says. There have been 14 deaths so far during the ongoing fiscal, with the latest being reported on November 21, when an infant was bitten by a cobra in Malappuram. “Nearly 58,000 snakes have been safely rescued and released back into their natural habitats,” he adds.\n\nPramod G. Krishnan, Chief Wildlife Warden, says the recent declaration of snakebite envenomation as a notifiable disease will be a “shot in the arm” for Kerala’s goal of zero snakebite deaths by 2030. The Forest Department is now all set to launch the second phase of SARPA with expanded resources and training.\n\nEnvironmental and lifestyle shifts have also contributed to fewer human-snake encounters. “The elimination of open defecation, near-universal LPG coverage and reduced dependence on firewood, and mechanised farming practices have all helped,” says Dr. Jaideep C. Menon, Professor, Adult Cardiology and Public Health, Amrita Institute of Medical Sciences, Kochi.\n\nBesides, the Local Self Government Department, the General Education Department, and other departments have adopted many precautionary measures. “Safety audits are being regularly conducted in schools before each academic year to identify and rectify potential hazards,” Anwar says.\n\nThe State has also prioritised supplying safety equipment, including gumboots and gloves, to Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) workers, given the risks of snake encounters in rural regions.\n\nShyamala M., a MGNREGS worker in Palode, Thiruvananthapuram, points out that she is now given gloves while carrying out tasks such as clearing vegetation. “Last year, one of my colleagues was bitten by a hump-nosed pit viper. Incidents like that used to be common,” she says.\n\nWayanad-based physician Dr. Rajesh Kumar M.P., who also serves as a SARPA educator, says efforts are being made to spread awareness about snakes and venomous species, particularly among the youth. SARPA Padam, an educational programme, is being rolled out across educational institutions. Awareness sessions are also conducted for groups such as Kudumbasree.\n\nAlso Read | Study finds climate change could drive new snakebite hotspots in India\n\nThe hurdles that remain\n\nDespite achieving significant progress in handling snakes and preventing snakebite-related fatalities, Kerala still faces challenges, however.\n\nNationally, snakebite mitigation largely centres around the Big Four snake species — the Indian cobra, the common krait, the Russell’s viper, and the saw-scaled viper. However, in Kerala, the hump-nosed pit viper is increasingly responsible for snakebite cases. The viper is an endemic species to the Western Ghats.\n\nDr. Menon attributes the rise in hump-nosed pit viper bites to the shift in agricultural patterns from paddy cultivation to plantation-based cash crops, such as rubber and cardamom. The venomous species is known to prefer cool, moist environments, such as dense forests and plantations. It is mostly found in leaf litter and thick bushes.\n\nThe polyvalent ASV that is produced in India utilises venom from the Big Four. However, studies have shown that it is ineffective in neutralising the venom of the hump-nosed pit viper.\n\nDr. Menon, who also heads the ICMR-Collaborative Centre of Excellence in Snakebite, stresses the need to establish regional venom collecting centres. “This is necessary to improve antivenom production by developing both region-specific and species-specific antivenoms,” he says.\n\nAt present, like most other States, Kerala relies on the ASV produced from the venom extracted by the Irula Snake Catchers’ Industrial Cooperative Society in Chengalpattu, Tamil Nadu. The Irula are an indigenous community known for their traditional skills in snake and rat catching. In July 2025, while inaugurating the World Snake Day observance in Thiruvananthapuram, Forest Minister A.K. Saseendran announced plans to locally produce ASV to address the perceived ineffectiveness of current antivenoms due to geographical variation in venom potency.\n\nSustaining SARPA’s momentum is another challenge, according to a senior forest official. Of the 3,300 trained and licensed snake rescuers, fewer than 1,000 remain active. “While many snake enthusiasts have undergone training in snake rescue, they are rarely available on short notice, given their daily jobs,” the official says.\n\nA rapid response team (RRT) member in Pathanamthitta points out that snake-related emergencies in the region are primarily handled by Forest Department personnel, largely due to the lack of licensed snake handlers in the area. While RRT teams have been effective in managing a range of emergencies, their resources are increasingly being stretched, particularly as forest fringe areas report a rise in conflicts involving other wild animals such as elephants and wild boars. To address the issue, the department is mulling steps to ensure at least one active licensed snake handler in each local body.\n\nPersisting medical challenges too remain a significant barrier to effective snakebite management. “There is clinical hesitancy in administering ASV, primarily due to fear of anaphylaxis (a severe, life-threatening allergic reaction). This is often linked to inadequate training and insufficient infrastructure to manage complications,” says a health officer.\n\nTimely and effective pre-hospital care too is vital in reducing snakebite-related mortality. While emergency services exist, most snakebite victims still rely on private transport. Experts have called for strengthening ambulance services to include snakebite management protocols, and for implementing a hub-and-spoke model, where community health centres and taluk hospitals support a network of primary health centres.\n\nHerpetologist Sandeep Das says Kerala’s focus on snakebite mitigation in recent times has had a cascading effect on conservation efforts. “Snakes play a vital role in maintaining a healthy ecosystem by controlling rodent population. This in turn helps reduce the spread of zoonotic diseases,” he says.\n\nDas, who has been actively involved in SARPA and Snakepedia, a comprehensive database on snake species found in Kerala, adds that there has been a perceptible shift in public attitudes towards snakes. “Where fear and hostility once dominated, there is now a growing sense of awareness and respect for these often misunderstood reptiles. Increasingly, people are recognising their ecological importance and the need to respond to encounters with scientific knowledge, rather than fear-driven actions like killing them on sight,” he says.\n\nAs the State pushes towards its goal of zero snakebites, the systemic overhaul sparked by a child’s death continues to serve as both a cautionary tale and a catalyst for change.\n\nsarath.bg@thehindu.co.in",

But, substantively, it is a blow to federalism as it effectively allows Governors unchecked powers to block or delay State legislation without constitutional accountability. This opinion contradicts a progressive judgment in April 2025 that had prescribed three-month timelines and used Article 142 to grant deemed assent to some Bills passed in the Tamil Nadu Assembly. The Court invoked separation of powers to reject timelines and Article 142’s use, but this empowers Governors at the cost of State rights. The judgment claims that Articles 200 and 201 prescribe no deadlines, but disregards explicit constitutional text. In Article 200, the Governor must declare his decision “as soon as possible” — the Court called it too “elastic” to support timelines, rendering constitutional text unenforceable. The Court’s assertion that Governors are not bound by the Council of Ministers’ aid and advice contradicts constitutional history. The framers explicitly removed the phrase “in his discretion” — a phrase in the Government of India Act, 1935 — from Articles 200 and 201. Even the Sarkaria Commission recommended a six-month period for Governors to decide on Bills.\n\nThe Court did rule that withholding assent must be followed by returning the Bill to the Assembly. But the judgment rules that even if the Assembly passes the Bill a second time, the Governor retains the option to reserve it for the President. This kills the binding nature of the legislature’s second passage. Consequently, whether at first instance or after reconsideration, a Governor can refer a Bill to the President under Article 200. Once there, Bills can languish indefinitely as the judgment ruled that the President has no obligation to consult the Court. The Assembly has no recourse to re-pass Bills in a binding manner, and the judgment provides no guidance on when referring a Bill to the President is appropriate. While the judgment talks of a “limited mandamus” for prolonged inaction, it refuses to define what constitutes a “reasonable period of time”, forcing States into legal battles to prove delay. By removing procedural safeguards (timelines and deemed assent), extraordinary remedies (Article 142), and oversight (judicial review of actions under Article 200), the Court’s opinion has allowed the possibility of executive overreach. States have little mechanism to challenge arbitrary delays, no automatic approval after reasonable periods, and no remedy when Bills are referred to the President, even on subjects under the State List. And these are situations that have recently transpired in many Opposition-ruled States. The Court appears to have found a way to turn the letter against the spirit of the Constitution.",

      "success": "The 2025 Bihar Assembly elections delivered a result many had expected, but the intensity of the victory surprised several observers. Caste alignments and alliance partners continued to matter, yet welfare delivery emerged as a central, though not exclusive, factor shaping the verdict.\n\nThe National Democratic Alliance’s (NDA) governance record and leadership, combined with the well-timed and highly visible rollout of welfare schemes, blurred the line between routine governance and election-focused initiatives. Evidence from a post-poll survey conducted by PollsMap reinforces this: welfare schemes in Bihar reached people on an impressive scale, and voters knew whom to credit, shaping their political perceptions and choices.\n\nWelfare penetration\n\nWelfare penetration during the Janata Dal (United)-led government was extensive. Going by survey responses, more than four-fifths of households benefited from the Har Ghar Bijli Yojana, and nearly seven in ten received support from the Har Ghar Nal Ka Jal Yojana.\n\nWomen-focused initiatives also reached a large number of households. Roughly one-third of households benefited from the Balika Poshak Yojana, which provides school uniforms for girls, and about one-fifth availed the Swayam Sahayata Bhatta Yojana, offering a monthly allowance of ₹1,000 for unemployed youth seeking work.\n\nA key political turning point in this election was the Mukhyamantri Mahila Rojgar Yojana, launched shortly before the election, which provided a direct cash transfer of ₹10,000 to women. Nearly three in five respondents reported that they or someone in their household had benefited from this scheme, highlighting its rapid and widespread reach.\n\nBeyond the immediate financial support, the scheme also reminded voters of Nitish Kumar’s long record of working for women through education support, bicycles, and other programmes. This mix of new and past benefits strengthened support, especially among women, for the ruling alliance.\n\nSurvey findings also indicated that the reach of these schemes was broad. Beneficiaries were spread across marginalised communities, rural households, and low-income groups, showing that the distribution was widespread.\n\nCredit attribution\n\nCrucially, what strengthened the ruling NDA alliance even further was the clarity of credit attribution. Around seven in ten beneficiaries attributed the schemes to the State government, while about a quarter assigned credit to the Union government. Importantly, credit given to the Centre did not result in any political loss, since the JD(U) was part of the NDA at both the State and central levels. This clarity of credit sharply enhanced the ruling coalition’s political advantage from welfare delivery.\n\nThe data reveal an association between benefiting from schemes and voting behaviour. Beneficiaries of all the schemes showed higher support for the NDA compared to non-beneficiaries. The effect was especially pronounced in schemes with the highest reach.\n\nFor the Mahila Rojgar Yojana (57% beneficiaries), 54% of beneficiaries voted for the NDA, compared with 35% of non-beneficiaries — an exceptionally large 19-percentage point advantage. For Har Ghar Bijli (83% beneficiaries), 49% of beneficiaries supported the NDA versus 34% of non-beneficiaries — a 15-point advantage.\n\nFor Har Ghar Nal Ka Jal (69% beneficiaries), 51% of beneficiaries backed the NDA compared with 37% of non-beneficiaries — a 14-point advantage.\n\nFuture promises\n\nBeyond existing welfare schemes, voters’ choices were also shaped by promises of future benefits, which likely functioned as prospective welfare initiatives. Survey data show that Tejashwi Yadav’s promise of one government job per household influenced a substantial portion of respondents, with one-third (36%) reporting it affected their vote ‘a lot’ and another 23% saying ‘somewhat’.\n\nMr. Tejashwi’s job promise resonated across caste groups. While majorities of Mahagatbandhan’s (MGB) core supporters — Yadavs (52%) and Muslims (60%) — said it influenced their vote ‘a lot’, significant shares of other communities were also affected: over a quarter of Kurmi-Koeri and other OBC voters, and three in ten Dalits, reported strong influence of this promise on their vote choice.\n\nAlthough a smaller share, 13% of upper-caste voters also said the promise influenced their voting decision ‘a lot’.\n\nAmong those highly influenced by this promise, nearly two-thirds (62%) voted for the MGB, while about one-fourth backed the NDA. As the influence of the promise weakened, the MGB’s support declined and NDA support rose, peaking among those who said the promise did not influence at all.\n\nCaste-wise, 86% of Yadavs and 75% of Muslims, for whom the promise had a strong impact, voted for the MGB. Among non-M-Y communities, 22% of Kurmis and Koeris, and nearly half of Dalits who strongly felt about the promise, also supported the alliance. This shows that the promise not only reinforced the core support but also attracted some support from beyond it.\n\nSimilarly, the JD(U)’s commitment to create one crore government jobs for youth resonated strongly, influencing six of every ten respondents (28% ‘a lot’ and 32% ‘somewhat’). These findings indicate that even as voters evaluated existing schemes, aspirational promises played a complementary role, reinforcing the ruling alliance’s broader appeal.\n\nAmong voters who said JD(U)’s employment promise mattered ‘a lot’, a little over three-fifths voted for the NDA, while about one-fifth supported the MGB. The NDA support declined modestly as the influence decreased, though not nearly as steeply as the drop in MGB support across the categories of Mr. Tejashwi’s promise. This suggests that while Mr. Tejashwi’s promise mobilised MGB-leaning voters, the JD(U)’s promise helped consolidate the NDA’s base.\n\nThe welfare paradox\n\nJust over half (53%) felt that government schemes were merely election-time freebies that did little to change people’s lives, while nearly four in ten (37%) viewed them as a right of a citizen. And yet, they admit having benefited from the schemes. Views on pre-election cash transfers were even more critical: over 70% believed that giving money just before voting is wrong, while only about one-fifth saw nothing wrong with it.\n\nYet, when we examine actual voting patterns, the impact of these schemes becomes apparent. Among those who saw welfare as election-time freebies, a majority still voted for the parties delivering them: 34% backed the MGB and 54% supported the NDA. Those who considered welfare a citizen’s right were slightly more evenly split, with 39% voting for the MGB and 41% for the NDA.\n\nThis suggests that even voters with a critical or realistic understanding of the political purpose behind welfare measures were often persuaded to support the parties implementing them. This contradiction is also visible in the case of the ₹10,000 Mahila Rojgar Yojana. Sixty-nine percent of its beneficiaries believed that pre-election transfers were wrong, suggesting that while they benefited, they were aware of the political intent behind their timing.\n\nNon-beneficiaries expressed similar views, indicating that concerns about electoral manipulation extended across groups regardless of personal gain.\n\nProper implementation of a few key schemes added an important layer to the dynamics of the 2025 Bihar election. While it was not the only factor behind the NDA’s victory, effective welfare delivery strengthened the ruling side’s position.\n\nEven where voters questioned the timing or intent of new announcements, they still recognised benefits that reached them. This wide reach and clear credit attribution helped reinforce existing political support, contributing to the NDA’s victory.\n\nVibha Attri is a researcher at Lokniti. Views expressed are personal",

      "success": "The Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of electoral rolls became one of the most contentious issues in Bihar’s 2025 Assembly elections, with accusations and counter-accusations flying between the ruling National Democratic Alliance and the opposition Mahagatbandan. The Bharatiya Janata Party and its allies welcomed the process as necessary to remove “infiltrators” from voter lists, while the Congress and Rashtriya Janata Dal decried it as systematic disenfranchisement—part of what they termed “vote chori,” or vote theft, alleging collusion between the Election Commission of India and the ruling BJP to manipulate electoral rolls in the latter’s favour.\n\nThe controversy wasn’t confined to campaign rhetoric. The SIR process required multiple Supreme Court interventions, including orders to publish reasons for the deletion of names from the draft electoral roll and permission for electors to use Aadhaar as the 12th identity document for enrolment. The scale of the revision was unprecedented: approximately 68 lakh electors were deleted from Bihar’s electoral rolls, while 24 lakh were added, resulting in a net deletion of around 44 lakh voters between January 2025 and October 2025.\n\nGiven this backdrop, a critical question emerges: did the SIR process actually influence the election outcome? A data-driven analysis comparing changes in vote share patterns with the extent of electoral roll deletions across assembly constituencies suggests that it did not play a determining role in the NDA’s victory.\n\nThe electoral outcome itself showed remarkable continuity with the 2024 Lok Sabha elections. The NDA secured close to 46.6% of the vote share in the Assembly polls, a marginal drop of around 1.4 percentage points from the parliamentary elections held in May 2024. The Mahagatbandan’s vote share declined more sharply, falling by approximately 2.2 percentage points from 39.2% to 37%. While these shifts favoured the NDA, the pattern suggests the alliance retained rather than expanded its existing advantage over the opposition.\n\nTo examine whether the SIR process contributed to these patterns, we analysed two key variables across Bihar’s assembly constituencies: the change in the vote share difference between the NDA and MGB from the 2024 Lok Sabha elections to the 2025 Assembly elections, and the decrease in electorate numbers following the SIR as a percentage of the original electoral roll.\n\nThe below map illustrates the changes in vote share difference between the two elections at the assembly constituency level. Darker red shading indicates constituencies where the NDA increased its advantage over the MGB, while darker blue shading shows the opposite.\n\nThe below map depicts the decrease in the electorate across constituencies, with darker red indicating larger percentage reductions in voter numbers following the SIR process.\n\nThe below chart plots these two variables against each other for every assembly constituency in Bihar. If the SIR process had systematically benefited the NDA by removing opposition voters, we would expect to see a clear pattern: constituencies with higher deletions showing greater increases in NDA’s vote share advantage. The scatter plot, however, tells a different story.\n\nThe correlation coefficient between these variables is 0.192, indicating an extremely weak positive relationship. To understand what this means, consider that correlation coefficients range from -1, representing a perfect negative correlation, to +1, representing a perfect positive correlation, with 0 indicating no relationship whatsoever. At 0.192, the data reveals virtually no meaningful connection between the extent of electoral roll deletions in a constituency and the change in the NDA’s advantage over the MGB.\n\nThis is further confirmed by the R² value of 0.037 visible in the chart’s trendline, which indicates that only 3.7% of the variation in the NDA’s electoral performance can be explained by changes in the electoral roll. In practical terms, assembly constituencies that experienced large-scale deletions were no more likely to see an increase in the NDA’s vote share advantage than constituencies with minimal deletions. Similarly, constituencies with smaller reductions in the electorate showed no distinct pattern in voting behaviour compared to those with larger reductions.\n\nThe scatter plot itself is revealing. Points are dispersed widely across both axes with no clear upward or downward trend. The near-flat trendline and the clustering of points across the entire spectrum suggest that the SIR’s impact, if any, was not a determining factor in electoral outcomes. Had the revision systematically disenfranchised opposition voters to the NDA’s benefit, the data would show constituencies with higher deletion rates trending toward greater NDA advantage—a pattern conspicuously absent from the analysis.\n\nThe conclusion is straightforward: there was no major increase in NDA vote shares relative to the decrease in the electorate across Bihar. The NDA’s advantages from the 2024 Lok Sabha elections remained largely intact, and the coalition’s victory appears to have been based on the same factors that gave it an edge in the parliamentary polls rather than being a product of the SIR process.\n\nThis is not to diminish the concerns about the SIR process. After all, data revealed that there was a disproportionate decrease in the number of women in the electorate following the SIR, leading to the gender ratio dropping from 907 in the January rolls to a meagre 892 in the final rolls released in September. And yet women turned out in much larger numbers compared to men (four lakh more despite being forty lakh fewer in the rolls).\n\nHowever, the data also suggests that the SIR, despite being a major political flashpoint and campaign issue besides being a flawed administrative step, did not alone determine the outcome of Bihar’s 2025 Assembly elections.",

      "success": "For the first time in his two decades as Bihar Chief Minister, Nitish Kumar has given up the Home department and other key portfolios to his allies in the Bharatiya Janata Party, which emerged as the single largest party with 89 seats in the State Assembly election earlier this month.\n\nMr. Kumar allocated portfolios to 26 Ministers on Friday (November 21, 2025), of which 46% have criminal records, while 88% are millionaires.\n\nOne of his two Deputy CMs, BJP leader Samrat Choudhary, has been given the Home department, a portfolio that Mr. Kumar had previously handled personally since November 2005. Other key departments that he has given up to BJP Ministers include Health, Agriculture, Revenue and Land Reforms, Mines, Industry, Road Construction, Urban Development, and Backward and Extremely Backward Class Welfare. The party has 14 members in the Cabinet.\n\nThe eight Ministers from Mr. Kumar’s own party, the Janata Dal (United), were allocated the Water Resources, Building Construction, Energy, Rural Development, Rural Works, and Education departments, among others. The party had won 85 seats in the Assembly election.\n\nThe Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas), led by Chirag Paswan, had won 19 seats in the poll and has been given two Cabinet berths, in charge of Public Health Engineering, and the Sugarcane Industry.\n\nThe Rashtriya Lok Morcha, led by Upendra Kushwaha, has been allocated the Panchayati Raj portfolio. This will be held by Mr. Kushwaha’s son Deepak Prakash who had taken oath as Minister on November 20 without being a member of either the upper or lower Houses of the Bihar legislature, but is likely to soon be elected as a member of the State Legislative Council.

      "text": "For the first time in his two decades as Bihar Chief Minister, Nitish Kumar has given up the Home department and other key portfolios to his allies in the Bharatiya Janata Party, which emerged as the single largest party with 89 seats in the State Assembly election earlier this month.\n\nMr. Kumar allocated portfolios to 26 Ministers on Friday (November 21, 2025), of which 46% have criminal records, while 88% are millionaires.\n\nOne of his two Deputy CMs, BJP leader Samrat Choudhary, has been given the Home department, a portfolio that Mr. Kumar had previously handled personally since November 2005. Other key departments that he has given up to BJP Ministers include Health, Agriculture, Revenue and Land Reforms, Mines, Industry, Road Construction, Urban Development, and Backward and Extremely Backward Class Welfare. The party has 14 members in the Cabinet.\n\nThe eight Ministers from Mr. Kumar’s own party, the Janata Dal (United), were allocated the Water Resources, Building Construction, Energy, Rural Development, Rural Works, and Education departments, among others. The party had won 85 seats in the Assembly election.\n\nThe Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas), led by Chirag Paswan, had won 19 seats in the poll and has been given two Cabinet berths, in charge of Public Health Engineering, and the Sugarcane Industry.\n\nThe Rashtriya Lok Morcha, led by Upendra Kushwaha, has been allocated the Panchayati Raj portfolio. This will be held by Mr. Kushwaha’s son Deepak Prakash who had taken oath as Minister on November 20 without being a member of either the upper or lower Houses of the Bihar legislature, but is likely to soon be elected as a member of the State Legislative Council. Santosh Suman of the Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular) has been given the Minor Water Resources portfolio.\n\n“Since our Chief Minister Nitish Kumar ji has been an experienced leader holding the post of CM for such a long period, he knows how to utilise the potential of leaders and it is as per his experience, the Ministers have been allocated the portfolios”, said JD(U) spokesperson Arvind Nishad. “There is nothing to read between the lines.

With an estimated 210 million crypto users, surpassing the 180 millionin the United States, the country has become a heavyweight in retail participation. This rapid momentum is no accident. Indian users are digitally savvy, eager to explore new asset classes, and far more discerning about platform integrity than ever before. In this dynamic landscape, platform security has quietly become the single most critical factor shaping user trust.Early experiences of new investors reveal why this intense focus on security is justified. Platforms with minimal verification layers, weak authentication processes, or inadequate monitoring may seem seamless initially. Yet, these gaps become visible when suspicious activities go unnoticed, verification steps falter, or breaches occur, jeopardizing both user trust and platform reputation.Global leaders like Binance have set the gold standard by embedding rigorous safeguards and operational integrity into every core aspect of their platforms.SB Seker, Head of APAC, Binance, emphasizes, “Our registration with FIU-IND reflects our unwavering commitment to thorough user verification and anti-money laundering protocols. Beyond regulatory compliance, we deploy advanced security technologies, such as biometric facial recognition, multi-factor authentication, and continuous real-time monitoring of transactions and account activities, to protect our users and uphold the platform’s integrity. ”To bolster user confidence and transparency, Binance also introduced pioneering measures designed to demonstrate asset safety and platform reliability:Recent assessments by blockchain analytics firms Chainalysis and TRM Labs show a marked decline in illicit digital assets activity across centralized exchanges between early 2023 and mid-2025. According to their findings, only 0.018–0.023%of total transaction volume on the seven largest exchanges in June 2025 was linked to illicit addresses — the lowest level recorded so far.Both firms report that Binance maintains the lowest share of illicit exposure among major global exchanges, despite handling volumes comparable to the next six platforms combined.These datasets also show that Binance reduced its illicit exposure by 96–98% from 2023 to 2025, outpacing improvements seen across other leading exchanges. The decline coincides with heightened monitoring systems, expanded compliance teams, and deeper coordination with global agencies.Comparatively, traditional finance continues to face far larger challenges, with global studies estimating that 2–5% of worldwide GDP is laundered annually through fiat channels. Against this backdrop, digital assets' share of illicit activity has become substantially smaller and increasingly traceable.Binance’s contributions to securing the digital asset ecosystem are multifaceted and extensive:Over 1,280 professionals dedicated globally to compliance, investigations, and risk management represent 22% of Binance’s workforce.Binance has processed more than 240,000 requests and conducted 400+ training sessions for investigative agencies worldwide.In India, Binance works closely with law enforcement agencies providing critical blockchain analysis and forensic support to help dismantle major scams and enhance user protection.Participation in initiatives like the Beacon Network and T3+ programme alongside Tether, TRON, and TRM Labs enables real-time freezing and tracing of illicit funds.Boasting 22 regulatory approvals worldwide and certifications including SOC 2 Type II, ISO 27001, ISO 27701, and PCI-DSS, Binance exemplifies the evolving standards of exchange operations, shifting from reactive responses toward proactive, analytics-driven prevention.Despite growing interest, many new investors rely on informal online sources. A 2025 CoinData study found that 70%of young Indian investors learned about digital assets primarily through YouTube, versus 40% who referred to traditional finance media.- Binance Academy provides multi-language content on blockchain fundamentals, security practices, Web3, and responsible trading.- Community initiatives like the Binance Blockchain Yatra offer hands-on guidance, complementing broader financial literacy efforts in India.“Our focus is on equipping users with knowledge, not just onboarding them,” says Kushal, Growth and Operations Lead, South Asia, Binance. “The Blockchain Yatra initiative is designed to demystify digital assets, help users understand security risks, and encourage informed participation.

The federal police acted on a request from Brazil’s Supreme Court, though neither institution provided further details, reported AP.Bolsonaro was detained around 6 am and moved from his residence in the upscale Jardim Botanico neighbourhood of Brasilia to the federal police headquarters, his aide Andriely Cirino told the agency. Local media had earlier reported that the 70-year-old leader, having exhausted all appeals, was scheduled to start his sentence next week.The arrest marks an escalation from his house arrest status, imposed in August. His lawyer Celso Vilardi told AFP, \"He has been imprisoned, but I don't know why,\" adding that the defence had argued for him to serve the sentence at home due to health concerns.Bolsonaro, who governed Brazil from 2019 to 2022, has maintained that the charges related to the 2022 coup attempt are politically motivated. The federal police’s brief statement announcing the operation did not name him but confirmed that the detention followed a Supreme Court directive",

The federal police acted on a request from Brazil’s Supreme Court, though neither institution provided further details, reported AP.Bolsonaro was detained around 6 am and moved from his residence in the upscale Jardim Botanico neighbourhood of Brasilia to the federal police headquarters, his aide Andriely Cirino told the agency. Local media had earlier reported that the 70-year-old leader, having exhausted all appeals, was scheduled to start his sentence next week.The arrest marks an escalation from his house arrest status, imposed in August. His lawyer Celso Vilardi told AFP, \"He has been imprisoned, but I don't know why,\" adding that the defence had argued for him to serve the sentence at home due to health concerns.Bolsonaro, who governed Brazil from 2019 to 2022, has maintained that the charges related to the 2022 coup attempt are politically motivated. The federal police’s brief statement announcing the operation did not name him but confirmed that the detention followed a Supreme Court directive",

During a candid appearance on the “Angie Martinez IRL” podcast, Ciara spoke at length about the dynamic she shares with the New York Giants quarterback, especially their three-year age gap, something she says has only added depth to their connection.For Ciara, Wilson is not just younger on paper; he’s the emotional anchor in their marriage, someone whose “old soul” and grounded demeanor bring stability during the pressure-filled chaos of NFL life and fame.While discussing the early years of their relationship and the evolution of their bond, Ciara shared that Russell often feels more mature than she does, despite being younger. “I do like to live young,” she said. “And then obviously my husband’s younger than me too, so I gotta keep it here. He’s an old soul, to be honest with you, he might be a little more older than me.”She added, “Sometimes I feel his fullness as a man, and that feels good.”It’s a sentiment that mirrors what fans repeatedly see in their public exchanges; respect, partnership, and a deep emotional alignment.That admiration was on full display back in October when Ciara penned a heartfelt Instagram message thanking Wilson for a surprise birthday celebration. “Baby, thank you for always making me feel on top of the world and for throwing the best surprise birthday party!” she wrote. “You always make every moment for me, big or small, feel special and important! You are the best!! I love you soooooo much.”The couple continues to shrug off online chatter, including the long-running “corny” label directed at Wilson. Ciara addressed that narrative months earlier on “The Breakfast Club,” responding with grace and conviction. “Why would I even respond to that, you know what I’m saying?” she said. “[He’s] the most amazing human being you can know… What you see with him is really who he is. So, it’s beautiful, it’s different. ”As the pair publicly embraces discussions about expanding their family, one thing remains clear: Ciara sees Russell not just as her partner, but as the grounding force who brings consistency, love, and an unwavering sense of maturity into their life together.Also Read: Russell Wilson and Ciara celebrate a Hollywood milestone as their first major film breaks into the year’s top 100",
